# FreeTube

A native SwiftUI YouTube client for iOS. Cookie-based auth, AVPlayer playback, offline downloads, no Google API key.

For personal use, sideload, or TestFlight only — **not** for public App Store submission.

## Changes in the `tankxu` branch

This branch contains the iPhone-focused changes used by the `com.tankxu` build:

- Changed the app bundle identifier and related namespaces to `com.tankxu`.
- Fixed iOS download handling after the bundle identifier migration.
- Made normal playback stream-first, so videos start without waiting for a complete download.
- Kept **Download before playback** as an optional compatibility mode in Settings.
- Automatically opens the expanded player when a video is selected.
- Added **Retry** and **Download** recovery actions when a playable stream cannot be resolved.
- Keeps **Download** in the player's More Actions menu at all times; the menu does not include a delete action.
- Shows comments by default on the video page instead of opening the queue/playlist first.

The upstream behavior and source remain available on `main`; all custom changes are maintained on the `tankxu` branch.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 17.0 or later (real device recommended — Python / yt-dlp work, but Simulator can be flaky for ffmpeg-heavy paths)
- A Google account (or family-managed account); login is performed inside the app via a WebView

---

## Build

```bash
git clone <this repo>
open FreeTube/FreeTube.xcodeproj
```

Open in Xcode, set your signing team on the FreeTube target, then ⌘R.

Swift Package dependencies resolve automatically. If you hit "No such module 'FFmpegSupport'" or "No such module 'Kingfisher'" warnings from SourceKit, ignore them — `xcodebuild` still produces `BUILD SUCCEEDED`. Product → Clean Build Folder clears the stale index.

---

## Architecture

```
SwiftUI Views
   ↓ @Environment
@Observable ViewModels (Features/*)
   ↓ async / await
Services (Core/Networking/*)        ←  one Service per YouTubeKit response family
   ↓
YouTubeKitClient (cookies + visitor data)  +  DownloadManager (yt-dlp + ffmpeg)
   ↓
b5i/YouTubeKit  +  kewlbear/YoutubeDL-iOS  +  FFmpegSupport
```

**MVVM with a service layer:**

- Views never `import YouTubeKit` or `YoutubeDL`.
- ViewModels never network directly; they call services.
- Services are the only place that talks to YouTubeKit, yt-dlp, or ffmpeg.

See `CLAUDE.md` § 6 for the exact mapping from YouTubeKit response types to service methods.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Library |
|---|---|
| UI | SwiftUI (`@Observable`, iOS 17+) |
| YouTube API | [`b5i/YouTubeKit`](https://github.com/b5i/YouTubeKit) — cookie-based, no API key |
| Stream extraction | [`kewlbear/YoutubeDL-iOS`](https://github.com/kewlbear/YoutubeDL-iOS) (yt-dlp via PythonKit) |
| In-process ffmpeg | `FFmpegSupport` |
| Playback | `AVFoundation` / `AVKit` (`AVQueuePlayer`, `AVPlayerViewController`, `AVPictureInPictureController`) |
| Mini / expanded player | `LNPopupUI` |
| Now-playing animation | `SwimplyPlayIndicator` |
| Images | `Kingfisher` |
| Persistence | `SwiftData` (`@Model` + `@ModelActor` writer for history/favorites/search) + file extended attributes for downloads metadata |
| Secure storage | Keychain via `Security.framework` |
| Logging | `os.Logger`, subsystem `com.tankxu` (matches the app bundle id) |

## Playback pipeline

Playback is stream-first. Existing offline files play locally; otherwise AVPlayer starts from HLS
or a progressive URL. The persistent yt-dlp pipeline is reserved for explicit downloads, the
optional download-before-playback setting, and the compatibility fallback when streaming fails.

```
User taps a video
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Preferred: AVPlayer streaming (no local file)               │
│   iOS HLS → iOS progressive → TVHTML5 HLS/progressive       │
│   Starts without waiting for a complete download            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │   unavailable
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Fallback: yt-dlp / YouTubeKit download → local mp4          │
│   Mux video+audio in Swift via FFmpegRunner (-c copy)       │
│   Persists metadata to file xattrs (DownloadsStore)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Normal viewing does not create an offline file. Use the Download button when a video should remain
available offline.

## Workarounds you should know about

These are the non-obvious bits. If you're refactoring `Core/`, read them first.

### Python on iOS doesn't tolerate cross-thread access

`PythonKit` + CPython require single-thread interpreter access. A plain Swift `actor` rotates between cooperative-pool workers and Python crashes. `PythonRunner` uses a **custom `SerialExecutor`** backed by a `DispatchQueue(.utility)` so GCD reuses the same worker thread, plus strict Task chaining via a `pump()` drain so even `await`-induced reentry can't double-enter yt-dlp.

### ffmpeg's C library is not thread-safe

The `+faststart` post-pass crashes on concurrent calls (`EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `ff_format_shift_data`). `Hook.m`'s `setjmp`/`longjmp` is also unsafe across concurrent invocations. `FFmpegRunner` is a serial actor that all ffmpeg calls go through.

### yt-dlp's ffmpeg merger hangs on iOS

When yt-dlp's Python side calls `subprocess.Popen.communicate` against ffmpeg, the call never returns — `longjmp` tears through the Python interpreter stack. We pass `--ffmpeg-location /dev/null/no-ffmpeg` so yt-dlp fails fast at probe time instead of hanging, then mux ourselves with direct `FFmpegSupport.ffmpeg(...)` calls.

### YouTube's PoT and n-cipher

YouTube has been enforcing Proof-of-Origin Tokens and rotating the `n`-parameter cipher in player.js every 2-8 weeks. We solve the **n-cipher in-process** by faking a `deno` runtime to yt-dlp via JavaScriptCore — see CLAUDE.md §15.11 for the bridge architecture. **PoT** still requires Play-Integrity / DroidGuard attestation which a JS runtime can't provide; tier 3 streaming is the user-facing safety net for PoT-locked content.

### Cookie de-duplication prefers `.youtube.com`

Post-login, Apple's `WKHTTPCookieStore` returns identical cookies under both `.youtube.com` and `.google.com` scopes. YouTube only accepts the `.youtube.com` value. `CookieStore.dedupe` enforces that — length-based tiebreaking failed in practice (both scopes were 12 chars).

### Login WebView must use an ephemeral data store

`WKWebsiteDataStore.default()` reuses prior sessions and captures stale cookies. Login flow uses `.nonPersistent()`.

### `SubscriptionRegistry` reconciles YouTubeKit's gaps

YouTubeKit's `subscribeStatus` parser doesn't follow `pageHeaderRenderer` entity-key indirection. Channel screens always showed "Subscribe" even on subscribed channels until we added a `UserDefaults`-backed registry that subscribe/unsubscribe actions flip optimistically.

### `AVQueuePlayer.replaceCurrentItem(with:)` is a no-op on an empty queue

Use `removeAllItems()` + `insert(_:after:)`. The `loadItem` helper does this correctly.

### Don't log from SwiftUI body paths

`DownloadManager.localFile(for:)` is called from `Menu` bodies re-evaluating dozens of times per second under the player's KVO storm. Even `log.debug` floods the device log. Pure functions called from view bodies must be allocation-free and log-free.

---

## Authentication

1. `LoginScreen` shows a `WKWebView` against `accounts.google.com` using an **ephemeral** `WKWebsiteDataStore`.
2. After redirect to `youtube.com`, the cookies are read, de-duplicated (prefer `.youtube.com` scope), serialized to a Cookie-header string, and stored in Keychain.
3. `SessionManager.bootstrap()` reloads them at every app launch.
4. Required cookies: `SAPISID`, `__Secure-3PAPISID`, `LOGIN_INFO`, `SID`, `HSID`, `SSID`, `APISID`. All must be present for `.loggedIn`.
5. On expiry / 401: Keychain is wiped, `AuthState.loggedOut` is set, root routes to Login.

Cookies typically last 1-2 weeks of inactivity. There is no refresh mechanism — YouTube doesn't expose one for cookie-based clients.

---

## Downloads

Two paths into `DownloadManager.ensureDownloaded`:

1. **Explicit (Download button).** Saves the selected video at priority `.background`.
2. **Playback fallback / opt-in.** Used at priority `.userInitiated` only when remote streaming is unavailable or Download before playback is enabled.

Plus a third entry point for non-YouTube content:

3. **"Link" tab.** Paste any URL from one of ~2,000 sites yt-dlp supports (Vimeo, Twitter/X, TikTok, SoundCloud, Instagram, …). `YtDlpInfoService` probes via `extract_info`, the Preview screen renders a format picker, and the chosen variant is downloaded by `URLDownloadManager`. Optional on-device transcode to H.264 / MP3 via FFmpeg's `h264_videotoolbox` and `libmp3lame` encoders.

`PythonRunner` has a two-bucket priority queue. Play taps jump ahead of any queued background work (Download All, prefetch). It cannot preempt the currently-running yt-dlp — Python has no safe interrupt point.

All downloaded files land at the **Documents root** and are visible in the iOS Files app under "On My iPhone" (gated by `UIFileSharingEnabled` + `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` in Info.plist). Metadata (title, channel, original URL, compressed thumbnail, duration) travels with each file as an **extended attribute** — no SwiftData row, no sidecar files.

Settings:
- **Allow cellular data** (default on) — `NWPathMonitor` gates `ensureDownloaded`.
- **Download before playback** (default off) — restores persistent download-first playback.
- **Prefetch next video** — available only in download-before-playback mode.
- **Concurrent fragments** — yt-dlp `--concurrent-fragments`, default 4.
- **Download cache limit** — bytes. When exceeded, oldest downloads get evicted.

---

## Localization

`Localizable.xcstrings` is fully translated for **English / Spanish / Russian / French / German** (236 keys).

To add a string: use `String(localized:)` / `LocalizedStringKey` in code, build once, then translate the new `state: "new"` entries in the catalog.

---

## What this app does not do

Honest list:

- **Doesn't bypass YouTube's PoT enforcement.** Affected content streams via HLS instead of downloading. (N-cipher *is* solved in-process via the JSC bridge.)
- **Doesn't attempt App Store distribution.** Sideload, TestFlight, or personal use only.
- **Doesn't include analytics, telemetry, or remote logging.** Everything goes to `os.Logger`.
- **Doesn't have a refresh-token flow.** Cookies expire, you re-login.
- **Doesn't support Chromecast / Google Cast.** AirPlay only.
- **Doesn't have CarPlay** yet.
